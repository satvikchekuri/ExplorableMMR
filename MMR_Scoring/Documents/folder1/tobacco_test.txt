That is a broad question. philip morris establishs their own policies, depending on what kind of level of policy you're talking about.
You saw another handwritten sheet 9 that has about 15 hours in it for time in June and September. That is right.
It means that he is infected.
My title today is senior principal scientist.
What did I think they were personally doing?
I know why this particular topic was included in this notice of suspension. It was prior notice for another case that had that passage in it; for a request for retaining records related to that, if they existed.
No other reason.
That was Kool Milds after that.
Page 6 of my CV, the third reference, 1994, first author Dr. Ayres, "Design, construction, and operation of an inhalation system for exposing laboratory animals to environmental tobacco smoke." Technically that's a misnomer in the title, but we very quickly mentioned in the beginning introduction it's pretty well logistically impossible to do environmental tobacco smoke, because of the exhaled mainstream. So what we were really doing was exposing animals to sidestream. One of the concems we had was sidestream smoke is extremely dilute. Environmental tobacco smoke is extremely dilute. Sidestream coming from the smoke, coming from the cigarette in the ashtray between puffs is actually quite concentrated, but that's not what people would get in. let's say, conference rooms or other areas where smokers and nonsmokers would congregate. There's large amounts of diluting air comes in, and so the concentrations of ETS that nonsmokers are exposed to is actually very low. So to generate those very low concentrations we decided rather than doing nose-only exposures, as in the mainstream experience, we decided we wanted to use a much larger system called a whole body exposure system, which is essentially a stainless steel chamber that's about two cubic meters. So allowing large amounts of dilution of sidestream smoke that would then be inhaled by the mice in a low chamber, a mid chamber, and a high chamber. That's what this manuscript describes. We were concerned over the fact that animals exposed whole body, as opposed to nose only, can ingest large amounts of smoke orally. We want to avoid that, because that's not what happens to humans. As the rats groom themselves in the chamber they ingest large amounts of material that they've been exposed to by inhalation. So to avoid that possibility we placed the animals inside the nose-only tube, and then placed the nose-only tube inside the whole body chamber So it's an extremely difficult experiment to perform logistically, but that's what we describe in the third article on Page 6.
I didn't know that the cost of bringing a new drug to market increased by a third during my tenure. It is much of that is on the pharmaceutical company's time.
During the time I was well, I still practised medicine a little.
I don't know the rationale for the company that had the knowledge that it's products were harmful and promoted it with the kind of advertising that was commonly used in the 1940s and the 1950s.
Well, besides having made a note on Exhibit 3, I have other notation on how much time I have spent.
He didn't tell me anything about what he understands the cause for his lung cancer to be.
Dr. Dimarco is his immediate superior.
Well, I'm certainly competent to review pathology slides, but I'm not a pathologist, so I don't write reports, and I don't bill to write reports.
No, you're asking about epidemiology. I'm talking about this as proof that he did develop. And whether or not we took one thing away, would he have developed it? There's just no way of knowing that.
I know Mr. Green as he is a former work associate.
No, I didn't notice any difference in the way I smoke the Marlboro lights compared to the way I smoke the Cambridge lights.
The stamps are applied at the pack level of the products.
The American College of Governmental Industrial Hygienists establishes the currently established TLV in North America or the United States.
For a substance that has shown to have genotoxicity, it has some importance for me as a toxicologist.
The mature tobacco plant has a higher level of nicotine in the plant itself. In the process of producing cigarettes, processing the tobacco and manufacturing a cigarette, a signature amount of nicotine is lost in the process so that by the time you get to the end you've lost about half of the nicotine. 50 percent reduced in nicotine.
It's the International Agency of Research on Carcinogens. It's an international scientific body that puts designations on particular compounds and does research on whether or not certain compounds are carcinogenic or not.
I hadn't billed anything before today.
His doctors have described that his peripheral vascular disease is stable since 2006.
Based on the reports the doctors were concerned well, with the...
That would make him the top person when it comes to financing for the group of Altria.
Well, I think the purpose of the Frank's Statement was that the companies had got together after a variety of reports were showing up in both the popular press as well as the scientific press to talk about what they felt the state of the science was. Because at that time while there were the mouse skin painting results that had come out and the first epidemiology had come out, there were a number of scientific authorities that didn't necessarily think that the case  was shut in terms of relationship between smoking and health. Frank's Statement is really talking about what they feel the current state of knowledge is. But the other purpose of the Frank's Statement was to announce the formation of the Tobacco Institute Research Council, excuse me, the Tobacco Industry Research Council where the companies had pledged to spend a significant amount of money in research to try to make a firm determination on smoking and health-related issues and that's the other part of this advertisement that ran in a number of newspapers.
That was for the entire Philip Morris Usa company.
The average approval time when I arrived at the FDA was 36 months. By the time I had left, that had been cut to approximately 12, 14 months.
I don't have any understanding if I agree or disagree with the "no threshold model in determination of cancer risk," as established.
The number of cigarettes that I smoked remained pretty constant during the period that I have been smoking Cambridge Lights from November 1986 to the present.
I was married before I got married to Ms. Links.
The first page and the last are certainly the disposal suspension notice that I have in my master file of disposal suspension notices since I have that responsibility. But before I started making suspension notices, when I moved to the litigation department, John Madaric was the person I reported. And before that, John was making suspension of disposal notices. just that that
Paragraph 28 of my report refers to Judge Kessler's opinion. I obviously, didn't attend the DOJ trial in its entirety. I was there the first day.
I think it's been several years before I gave this testimony, so the independent monitoring committee is a California stem cell project. I believe that's Exhibit 8. If you can give me the full testimony, so I don't misstate so I understand the name in that case.
I know what your client knew. Your client certainly described the fact that the side effects of cigarette smoking in 1963 included some negatives like lung cancer and emphysema, Addison Yeaman in 1963.
As far as ammonia is concerned, I think I have to go back to my previous answer. I'm happy to explain again. I'm not professing personal knowledge of the events described in the documents.
I said that the cancer was undefined in the Ellis case that went to trial on February 27, 2014, in Tallahassee.
There's some reason why I said, "Today, there is a concern." I say that because I'm talking about it in reference to the time I've been with the company. I wasn't affiliated with the tobacco industry or the tobacco institute before I came to Reynolds. I can talk about what I know and the actions that I've been involved with.
there weren't any such times when some of the product had already been shipped out of the public warehouse.
So his total cholesterol, the HDL ratio was really pretty good, 5.2. And 5 would put him at average risk.
I have no knowledge of what the estimated deaths per 100,000 workers would be at the currently established PEL for any time measurement, be it a 20-year work period or a 40-year work period or any other
Non-specific symptom, including weight loss and fatigue, can be symptomatic of advanced cancers but in this case they are not. So that's why I'm quibbling with the question.
I was in charge of the team that wrote the jurisdictional statement.
Before I retired, I saw 20 to 40 patients daily.
Selecting 0.1 fibers per cc wasn't a justification but a suggestion that they could make it lower.
My other sources of income are as follows. I write books, I have my academic work and I am on the board of directors.
